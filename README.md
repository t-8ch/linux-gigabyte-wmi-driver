Open questions:
* The ASL IndexField does not cover all relevant registers, can it be extended somehow?
* Not all registers are exposed via ACPI methods, can they be accessed directly?
* Some registers are exposed via ACPI methods but are not reachable directly from the WMI dispatcher.
  * Does ASL have some sort of reflection that could enable those methods?
  * Is it possible to call those methods directly, bypassing WMI?

## Installation

* `make install`
* `sudo insmod ./gigabyte-wmi.ko`

## Testing

* `cat /sys/devices/platform/gigabyte-wmi/hwmon/hwmon*/temp*input`
* `sensors`
